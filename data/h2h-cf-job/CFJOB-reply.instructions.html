<h2 id="the-task">The Task</h2>
<p>
Imagine that you are playing a game where you can play either as <span class="sys"><strong>a hotline operator</strong></span> , or a <span class="user"><strong>client</strong></span> which tries to <strong>find a restaurant for tonight in Cambridge</strong>. The <span class="user">client</span> is given a predefined goal to find information about a specific kind of restaurant they want to visit. The <span class="sys"> hotline operator </span> tries to help the <span class="user">client</span> to find a restaurant which satisfies <span class="user">client's</span> requirements.
</p>

<p>
The rules of game are that after you write a reply either as a <span class="user">client</span> or as <span class="sys">operator</span> you pass the conversation to other players and you pick a random conversation from other players for the next round. In this CrowdFlower job <strong>you provide a reply and in the next round you are assigned a new conversation and role (either <span class="sys">operator</span> or <span class="user">client</span>).</strong> 
</p>

<p>
The goal of the game is to create conversations which satisfy <span class="user">client's</span> goals, are natural, polite and are relevant to the topic.
