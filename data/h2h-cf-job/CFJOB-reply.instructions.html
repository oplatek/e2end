<h3 id="the-task">The Task</h3>

<p>
Imagine you are playing a game where you can play either a <strong>hotline operator or client</strong> which tries to <strong>find a restaurant for tonight in Cambridge</strong>.
The client has given a predefined goal what kind of  restaurant he want to visit.
The hotline operator tries to help the client to find one of the restaurant which satisfies client requirements.
</p>

<p>
The rules of games are that after you write a reply either as a client or as operator you pass the conversation to other players and you pick random conversation from other players for next round.
In this task's implementation <strong>you provide a reply and in the next round you are assigned a new conversation and role (either operator or client).</strong> 
</p>

<p>
The goal of the game is to create conversations which satisfy client goals, are natural, polite and are achieved in shortest number of rounds.
